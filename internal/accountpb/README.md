# accountpb — vendored account-core contracts

A copy of `account/proto/openpak/account/v1` (generated stubs + the `.proto` sources they
come from), the same way the website and the Switch adapter carry it: the account core is a
separate private repository, and a `replace => ../account` resolves only inside the local
workspace, so a clean checkout and CI could not build. To refresh: re-copy the files.
